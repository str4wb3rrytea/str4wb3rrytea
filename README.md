## Hi! I'm Sophia :D

I'm a first-year Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo - and I'm loving it so far.

I’m currently exploring frontend development (React/TypeScript), Firebase, and rapid prototyping with AI-assisted tools. Lots of learning happening on my end :) stay tuned for more!
